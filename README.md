- root `/` and dogs `/dogs`

- dogs endpoint displays random image of a dog, using this API https://random.dog/woof.json

## *To start an application use `Makefile`*
    make all

*or*

    make build name=<name of image>
    make run name=<name of image>

> docker run command is defaulted to port 8000, if you use another port, then go to `Makefile` and manually change port binding


## *Go to your browser and use `localhost:8000`*
- root endpoint `localhost:8000/`
- dogs endpoint `localhost:8000/dogs`
- docs `localhost:8000/docs`

>*By default port is 8000, but you can change it how you want*
 
>*Just remember that if your app is using some port X you need to bind it to Dokcer run port*
